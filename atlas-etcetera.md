# _Atlas_ setting notes

- Every person aboard the _Atlas_ is assigned a serial code, for data
  registration, record keeping, and proper fitting as it turns out. This is
  formatted as XXXX-YYY, where YYY is the sector the person lives in and XXXX
  is a distinct identifier hopefully unique to each person in a sector.
  Identifiers are only really retired once its current user has died, and it's
  considered traditional, especially amongst nobles, to reuse a serial code of
  a deceased ancestor for your firstborn. Codes are generally picked at random
  with the exception that the first governor was designated "0001". This
  tradition has usually been kept as the generations go by.
- Early in the first generation of the _Atlas_, a constructed language named
  Toki Pona was introduced to serve as an auxiliary language. It seemed like a
  good idea at the time. As the generations went on, this language evolved into
  what is known as the Toki. Or as it's better known, _maintenance-speak_. Most
  governors are fluent enough to at least _speak_ the language, at least enough
  to interact with whatever maintenance staff come through.
- The generic _Atlas_ fashion is the uniform, a full body covering somewhere
  between a jumpsuit and a unitard. It is a one-piece garment that covers the
  body except for the hands, feet, head and neck. The fact that the full
  garment must be removed to use the bathroom is a common gripe held amongst
  many a sector, but most sectors generally leave it alone. Notable exceptions
  are sectors 147 and 148. 147 has reduced their uniform to essentially
  lingerie, designed to, _ahem_, frame the human body. 148, on the other hand,
  has adopted a headscarf covering most of one's head leaving only a small
  region for the eyes, and covering the torso at least down to the serial. Thus
  the tradition for adding one's serial to the scarf, usually over where the
  mouth would be or directly below it.

# _Atlas_ setting questions

- How much interaction is there between sectors?
    * Ideally, there is at most only light interaction between the governors,
      because I want the various sectors to be independent enough to evolve
      novel cultures to play around with. How much is _necessary_ is a question
      I'm not entirely sure of the answer to.
- How much resources are there and how accessible are they?
    * In theory, the _Atlas_ is self-sustainable, in a way similar to what is
      known as an [arcology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology). The exact
      mechanics of this are something that I don't know and quite frankly don't
      understand.

# _Atlas_ story prompts

- What is life like in Sector 148?
    * I imagine that the sector has a decent fashion scene, with the _Atlas_
      uniform and headscarf/veil seen as a canvas to express oneself. Many
      young 148 children's first project is sewing or otherwise marking their
      serial onto their veil.
