# _Atlas_ setting notes

- Every person aboard the _Atlas_ is assigned a serial code, for data
  registration, record keeping, and proper fitting as it turns out. This is
  formatted as XXXX-YYY, where YYY is the sector the person lives in and XXXX
  is a distinct identifier hopefully unique to each person in a sector.
  Identifiers are only really retired once its current user has died, and it's
  considered traditional, especially amongst nobles, to reuse a serial code of
  a deceased ancestor for your firstborn. Codes are generally picked at random
  with the exception that the first governor was designated "0001". This
  tradition has usually been kept as the generations go by.
- Early in the first generation of the _Atlas_, a constructed language named
  Toki Pona was introduced to serve as an auxiliary language. It seemed like a
  good idea at the time. As the generations went on, this language evolved into
  what is known as the Toki. Or as it's better known, _maintenance-speak_. Most
  governors are fluent enough to at least _speak_ the language, at least enough
  to interact with whatever maintenance staff come through.
- The generic _Atlas_ fashion is the uniform, a full body covering somewhere
  between a jumpsuit and a unitard. It is a one-piece garment that covers the
  body except for the hands, feet, head and neck. The fact that the full
  garment must be removed to use the bathroom is a common gripe held amongst
  many a sector, but most sectors generally leave it alone. Notable exceptions
  are sectors 147 and 148. 147 has reduced their uniform to essentially
  lingerie, designed to, _ahem_, frame the human body. 148, on the other hand,
  has adopted a headscarf covering most of one's head leaving only a small
  region for the eyes, and covering the torso at least down to the serial. Thus
  the tradition for adding one's serial to the scarf, usually over where the
  mouth would be or directly below it.
- Sector 000 is a common euphemism for the parts of the ship not otherwise used
  by any other sector. Mostly this is hallways and the machinery that actually
  powers the ship, but it also holds all of the maintenance crew. Most people
  with first hand experience with maintenance regard them as quite _odd_. After
  all, they're engineers who spend more time around computers than people. The
  maintenance crew handles the basic functions of the ship, repair of the holy
  starship, trade between various sectors, and record keeping. These records
  are ..._distinctive_, and often not in the good way. In the "we lost an
  entire country because everybody assumed its location was so obvious as to
  never bother writing it _down_" way.
- A lot of Earth culture has not survived. The ship is loaded with plenty of
  documents, but they are scattered and seen by very few if any of its people.
  As such, the ship's various sectors have evolved its own cultures, descended
  from its earliest generations passed down to the later ones. The one document
  that every sector has access to is a list of guidelines the Atlas's creators
  had created for ensuring there would still be a human race when the ship
  landed. The most important of these rules is "take care to have offspring, so
  we may have a future". The various sectors have interpreted this instruction
  in various and interesting ways.

# _Atlas_ setting questions

- How much interaction is there between sectors?
    * Ideally, there is at most only light interaction between the governors,
      because I want the various sectors to be independent enough to evolve
      novel cultures to play around with. How much is _necessary_ is a question
      I'm not entirely sure of the answer to.
- How much resources are there and how accessible are they?
    * In theory, the _Atlas_ is self-sustainable, in a way similar to what is
      known as an [arcology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology). The exact
      mechanics of this are something that I don't know and quite frankly don't
      understand.

# _Atlas_ story prompts

- What is life like in Sector 148?
    * I imagine that the sector has a decent fashion scene, with the _Atlas_
      uniform and headscarf/veil seen as a canvas to express oneself. Many
      young 148 children's first project is sewing or otherwise marking their
      serial onto their veil.
- What are the maintenance staff like and how does life go for them?
    * This could probably be a whole story in and of itself. I'm a little
      excited about it but I'm probably going to need to make a _lot_ more
      decisions about the mechanics of the holy starship before I really get
      into it.
