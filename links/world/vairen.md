The Vai'ren
===========

- The basic tenet revolves around an ancestor [Vai], who was shunned from
  Hyrule and made to live in hiding. The Vai'ren are her descendants and it is
  their duty in life to honor her and pay back for those who had wronged her.

Faith
-----

- The Debt is a central element of the faith and "paying the debt" is a common
  way of saying that one follows the Vai'ren faith, but there's more to it than
  simply that.
- If you asked an observer what paying the debt meant to them, chances are the
  answer would be about _strength_. Strength of character: the morals to make
  the world better than the one that spurned the Ancestor. Strength of mind:
  the foundation to be able to carry oneself, especially against those who
  would shun then. Strength of body: the ability to defend against anything
  that might threaten them.

Clothing
--------

- Most Vai'ren cover themselves as a part of paying the debt. More conservative
  members of the faith dress in black garments that obscure the figure almost
  completely. More commonly though, the coverings are used as a means to
  express oneself: most Vai'ren decorate the veils covering their lower face as
  a way of declaring who they are and in some cases this is used as a form of
  ID.
- An interesting side effect of this is that most Vai'ren are non-gendered,
  since the Vai'ren strive to blend in with one another as much as possible;
  one only gets to see the physique of a Vai'ren in detail during extremely
  intimate moments. As such, many Hyrulean languages derive their terms for
  "non-binary" from the way they describe the Vai'ren.

      from, admittedly. This is something I'm doing for _me_.
- In terms of general aesthetic, I'm imagining clothing that is either loose
  and flowing, or something along the lines of exercise wear.
    - [Dignitii](https://www.dignitii.com) looks like a good place to find
      reference for this sort of look?
- Traditional Vai'ren wear: black veil covering all of the face except for the
  eyes and a black robe obscuring all of the figure except for the hands and
  feet. Generally only worn for ceremonial purposes or by extremely
  traditionalist members of the faith.
- Casual wear: a shawl to cover the head. A veil to cover the face, given a
  distinctive pattern to identify the wearer; distinctive veils may be given
  out as part of uniform for a job. Loose fitting dress and leggings to allow
  for fluid movement and not _quite_ as figure-obscuring as traditional wear.
  Often worn with an undershirt or gloves to account for the sleeves rising.
- Active wear: While the leggings are typically similar to casual wear, the
  dress has a number of accommodations to physical activity. The sleeves have a
  hole to insert the thumb so that it won't rise when the arm is lifted. A
  second layer of fabric is attached below the bustline to stick under the
  leggings. The skirt splits in two to allow for more leg movement while still
  covering the body when still.
    - It's worth noting that vai preparing for combat will usually ditch their
      veils in favor of face-covering masks, as to deny an easy grab for ...less
      _honorable_ opponents. Show-fighters are noted for having luchador-style
      masks that favor stylization.

Arts
----
- There is rather noticeably, no musical tradition amongst the Vai'ren. The
  usual explanation given is that it respects the melodies provided by the
  universe itself, though it's more accurate to say that music as an art form
  was rejected as a Hyrulean artifact that the Vai'ren wanted no part in.
- Instead, in its place, dance is given treatment as a high art form, the sort
  of thing fancy theaters are made for and which is seen as the "classical"
  form for the Vai'ren.
- In the way of _popular_ art, however, vai flock towards staged combat
  performances, in similar vein to real world pro wrestling, albeit with a
  different martial art being showcased.
    - Simple combat demonstrations were a frequent sight in the streets. This
      appealed to the populace quite a bit.
    - Eventually somebody got the idea that if the fights were staged, it'd be
      a lot easier to have more of them, since there's less of a risk of
      injury.
    - This eventually results in a storied and celebrated tradition of larger
      than life personalities squaring off in the ring.
    - Vai'ren show-fighters have some of the most decorated and flashy costumes
      their people can produce (while still respecting their rules for
      modesty). Comparisons to superhero costumes wouldn't be unwarranted.
