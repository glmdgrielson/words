The Vai'ren
===========

- The basic tenet revolves around an ancestor [Vai], who was shunned from
  Hyrule and made to live in hiding. The Vai'ren are her descendants and it is
  their duty in life to honor her and pay back for those who had wronged her.

Faith
-----

- The Debt is a central element of the faith and "paying the debt" is a common
  way of saying that one follows the Vai'ren faith, but there's more to it than
  simply that.
- The word "vai" is generally used to refer to any practitioner of the faith,
  as well as describing the demographic of communities heavily shaped by it,
  in the same way that one may be described as a "Christian" or a "Muslim" in
  the real world. In contrast, the word "voe" is used to describe those who do
  _not_ practice the faith or otherwise describe themself as vai. And yes,
  there are some more... conservative vai who use the label of "voe" for the
  purpose of discrimination.
- If you asked an observer what paying the debt meant to them, chances are the
  answer would be about _strength_. Strength of character: the morals to make
  the world better than the one that spurned the Ancestor. Strength of mind:
  the foundation to be able to carry oneself, especially against those who
  would shun then. Strength of body: the ability to defend against anything
  that might threaten them.
- Many of the smaller Vai'ren prayers are attached to exercises, so that they
  can be performed at a consistent tempo. As such, a Vai'ren workout is
  physically _and_ spiritually enriching.
    - I have been told that this is very close to the story behind yoga, which
      is a very fun coincidence!
- The sun is very often used as a religious symbol, used to euphemistically
  represent the Vai'ren Ancestor, who is usually otherwise forbidden from being
  physically depicted, as a measure of respect towards somebody who was
  wronged.
- For as much as the vai consider the Ancestor a spiritual figure, the rest of
  Hyrule consider her a historical figure, with a known name and face. This has
  been the source of conflict more than once. As well, more than one Zelda has
  attempted to make peace with the Vai'ren by attempting to address the
  specific misdeeds done towards her, though this has not succeeded, as the
  Vai'ren of the faith generally consider it too little too late.

Clothing
--------

- Most Vai'ren cover themselves as a part of paying the debt. More conservative
  members of the faith dress in black garments that obscure the figure almost
  completely. More commonly though, the coverings are used as a means to
  express oneself: most Vai'ren decorate the veils covering their lower face as
  a way of declaring who they are and in some cases this is used as a form of
  ID.
- An interesting side effect of this is that most Vai'ren are non-gendered,
  since the Vai'ren strive to blend in with one another as much as possible;
  one only gets to see the physique of a Vai'ren in detail during extremely
  intimate moments. As such, many Hyrulean languages derive their terms for
  "non-binary" from the way they describe the Vai'ren.

      pulled from, admittedly. This is something I'm doing for _me_.
- In terms of general aesthetic, I'm imagining clothing that is either loose
  and flowing, or something along the lines of exercise wear.
    - [Dignitii](https://www.dignitii.com) looks like a good place to find
      reference for this sort of look?
- Traditional Vai'ren wear: black veil covering all of the face except for the
  eyes and a black robe obscuring all of the figure except for the hands and
  feet. Generally only worn for ceremonial purposes or by extremely
  traditionalist members of the faith.
- Casual wear: a shawl to cover the head. A veil to cover the face, given a
  distinctive pattern to identify the wearer; distinctive veils may be given
  out as part of uniform for a job. Loose fitting dress and pants to allow for
  fluid movement and not _quite_ as figure-obscuring as traditional wear. Often
  worn with an undershirt or gloves to account for the sleeves rising.
- Active wear: While the pants are typically similar to casual wear, the dress
  has a number of accommodations to physical activity. The sleeves have a hole
  to insert the thumb so that it won't rise when the arm is lifted. A second
  layer of fabric is attached below the bustline to stick under the pants. The
  skirt splits in two to allow for more leg movement while still covering the
  body when still.
    - It's worth noting that vai preparing for combat will usually ditch their
      veils in favor of face-covering masks, as to deny an easy grab for
      ...less _honorable_ opponents. Show-fighters are noted for having
      luchador-style masks that favor stylization.

Lifestyle
---------
- One of the more important jobs in a Vai'ren community is the family arranger,
  usually just known as the arranger. Their job is to arrange those looking to
  bear children with potential mates, especially since directly asking a vai
  whether they are capable of bearing children is considered unspeakably
  forward outside of direct relatives. (Remember, to a practicing vai, their
  gender _is_ vai and their biological sex is none of your business.) An
  arranger is expected to be fairly knowledgable about the people in their
  community and to be able to assist in the development of a family. This might
  include sexual education, relationship counseling, and gynecology in a
  community that has developed far enough.
    - There are a pair of somewhat standardized euphemisms that arrangers and
      their clients use when discussing building a family: "looking to mate"
      implies male reproductive organs and "looking to bear" implies female
      reproductive organs. This is about as far as most vai are willing or
      interested in talking about their gender.

Arts
----
- There is rather noticeably, no musical tradition amongst the Vai'ren. The
  usual explanation given is that it respects the melodies provided by the
  universe itself, though it's more accurate to say that music as an art form
  was rejected as a Hyrulean artifact that the Vai'ren wanted no part in.
- Instead, in its place, dance is given treatment as a high art form, the sort
  of thing fancy theaters are made for and which is seen as the "classical"
  form for the Vai'ren.
- In the way of _popular_ art, however, vai tend to flock towards staged combat
  performances, in similar vein to real world pro wrestling, albeit with a
  different martial art being showcased.
    - Simple combat demonstrations were a frequent sight in the streets. This
      appealed to the populace quite a bit.
    - Eventually somebody got the idea that if the fights were staged, it'd be
      a lot easier to have more of them, since there's less of a risk of
      injury.
    - This eventually results in a storied and celebrated tradition of larger
      than life personalities squaring off in the ring.
    - Vai'ren show-fighters have some of the most decorated and flashy costumes
      their people can produce (while still respecting their rules for
      modesty). Comparisons to superhero costumes wouldn't be unwarranted.
