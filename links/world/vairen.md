The Vai'ren

- The basic tenet revolves around an ancestor [Vai], who was shunned from
  Hyrule and made to live in hiding. The Vai'ren are her descendants and it is
  their duty in life to honor her and pay back for those who had wronged her.

Clothing
--------

- Most Vai'ren cover themselves as a part of paying the debt. More conservative
  members of the faith dress in black garments that obscure the figure almost
  completely. More commonly though, the coverings are used as a means to
  express oneself: most Vai'ren decorate the veils covering their lower face as
  a way of declaring who they are and in some cases this is used as a form of
  ID.
- An interesting side effect of this is that most Vai'ren are non-gendered,
  since the Vai'ren strive to blend in with one another as much as possible;
  one only gets to see the physique of a Vai'ren in detail during extremely
  intimate moments. As such, many Hyrulean languages derive their terms for
  "non-binary" from the way they describe the Vai'ren.

- In terms of general aesthetic, I'm imagining clothing that is either loose
  and flowing, or something along the lines of exercise wear.

      reference for this sort of look?
- Traditional Vai'ren wear: black veil covering all of the face except for the
  eyes and a black robe obscuring all of the figure except for the hands and
  feet. Generally only worn for ceremonial purposes or by extremely
  traditionalist members of the faith.
- Casual wear: a shawl to cover the head. A veil to cover the face, given a
  distinctive pattern to identify the wearer; distinctive veils may be given
  out as part of uniform for a job. Loose fitting dress and leggings to allow
  for fluid movement and not _quite_ as figure-obscuring as traditional wear.
  Often worn with an undershirt or gloves to account for the sleeves rising.
- Active wear: While the leggings are typically similar to casual wear, the
  dress has a number of accommodations to physical activity. The sleeves have a
  hole to insert the thumb so that it won't rise when the arm is lifted. A
  second layer of fabric is attached below the bustline to stick under the
  leggings. The skirt splits in two to allow for more leg movement while still
  covering the body when still.
