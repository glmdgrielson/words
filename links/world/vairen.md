The Vai'ren

- The basic tenet revolves around an ancestor [Vai], who was shunned from
  Hyrule and made to live in hiding. The Vai'ren are her descendants and it is
  their duty in life to honor her and pay back for those who had wronged her.

Clothing
--------

- Most Vai'ren cover themselves as a part of paying the debt. More conservative
  members of the faith dress in black garments that obscure the figure almost
  completely. More commonly though, the coverings are used as a means to
  express oneself: most Vai'ren decorate the veils covering their lower face as
  a way of declaring who they are and in some cases this is used as a form of
  ID.
- An interesting side effect of this is that most Vai'ren are non-gendered,
  since the Vai'ren strive to blend in with one another as much as possible;
  one only gets to see the physique of a Vai'ren in detail during extremely
  intimate moments. As such, many Hyrulean languages derive their terms for
  "non-binary" from the way they describe the Vai'ren.

      from, admittedly. This is something I'm doing for _me_.
