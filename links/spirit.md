Spirit, a Link Mourned
======================

Some heroes get a legendary journey and tales that are passed down through the
ages.

Some heroes fade quietly into the night once their story ends and never truly
achieve greatness.

This hero just fell off a cliff. But he's getting a second go.

Personality
-----------

Oddly enough, dying has made Spirit more afraid of his own mortality. You'd
think it would be less, but Spirit is rather cautious of having another
accident. The fear of living on borrowed time is a big running theme in his
story.

Aside from that, he tries his best to be affable, despite the somewhat
unnerving appearance of, y'know, a risen corpse. The fact that most people
look at him with unease is defintely not getting to him, what are you talking
about?

Combat
------

Spirit, as said before, is afraid of dying _again_. As such, his combat style
is notably cautious and conservative. Spirit is a defensive fighter that avoids
a fight whenever possible. It helps that he's _stellar_ at playing dead.

Legend
------

A young Link has set out on an adventure. He is brave, confident, and a little
foolhardy, but a good hero nonetheless.

That all changes when he accidentally sends himself off a cliff. (If this were
a game, this would _absolutely_ be something done in gameplay and not a
cutscene, just to rub it in.) A day passes before the body rises again. Farore
was desperate and filled this Link's body with some spare essence, so her
precious child could go forth once more. (She didn't have the time to wait for
another one to come in.)

* Steam notices the green energy of Farore's will as well as the faint details
  of what Spirit looked like alive. This knowledge makes Spirit very
  uncomfortable.
