Fae, a Link of nature
=====================

This kid was raised by a Great Fairy. For those of you currently having
nightmares in the audience, yes, you've got _exactly_ the right idea.

Personality
-----------

Again, raised by a Great Fairy, so he has a lot of the same mannerisms. He
loves his mother dearly and has had many regrets that he cannot do the same
things that come so naturally to her. Things like flight and magic.

Combat
------

In Fae's perfect world, he's a support, casting spells to aid his companions in
times of need. It is an unfortunate struggle that he cannot, and his role
instead drifts towards drawing attention and dodging with elegance and grace.

Legend
------

A tragedy struck a dying village and in their final moments, a parent delivers
their child to a fairy fountain. Though the parent did not survive, the local
Great Fairy would spend the following years raising the child in her own
...inimitable way.

When the child was starting to come of age, a curious woman in a flowing purple
gown stopped by the fountain for aid and took interest in the Fairy's unusual
attendant.
