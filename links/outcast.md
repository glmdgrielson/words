Outcast, a Link of the Vai
==========================

Legend
------
Like many vai, Outcast grew up hearing of the tales of the misdeeds of the
kingdom of Hyrule. Unlike many vai, they took this not with the understanding
that things are unfortunately this way and to be strong in the face of it, but
with the understanding that this is something to be _settled_.

It is, then, very unfortunate, that the current Zelda has become frustrated
with the nature of Hyrule and is planning her own coup. And that Outcast
happens to be _very_ useful for this purpose.

Personality
-----------
Outcast is ..._mostly_ noble, by Vai'ren standards. They just have one very
unfortunate character flaw: _stubbornness_. Their quest is to settle a score
that has been lying for ages, and they were not talked out of it in time for
their coming of age.

Connections to Other Links
--------------------------
Most of them ain't pleasant! Outcast sees most of the Links as representative
of a kingdom they envision as unjust and not worth defending.
