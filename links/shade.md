Shade, the Twili Link
=====================

There's nothing that _says_ the fellow pulling out the magical artifact of holy
power _needs_ to be a blond, green-clad Hylian undergoing puberty.

This kid might wish there _were_ though. Because that stupid lamp _hurts_.

Shade is a Twili with an endlessly curious spirit. He's only _in_ this
situation because he wandered off, found a weird forest, and decided to have a
go at the free thing that he found. He is now regretting precisely _all_ of his
life decisions. Hero of legend he ain't.

Personality
-----------

Shade is a curious sort, the kind that will easily get distracted for a solid
month doing sidequests.

Combat
------

Shade is very good at smashing things with his magic plot item. After all,
crushing things that get in his way is a skill that he has used several times
to his benefit. On the other hand, he's very clever with _how_ he goes about
smashing things, looking for weak points or holes in foes' strategies.

Connections to Canon Links
-------------------------

* Lore _fascinates_ him. Unfortunately, the feeling is not mutual, as Lore
  tends to disapprove of Shade's habit of straight up ignoring puzzles.
* Gen gives him a lot of weird looks.
* Shadow is scary.
* He is forever sad that he'll never get to ride around in Dusk's shadow. He
  seems nice.
