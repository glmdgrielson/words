Shade, the Twili Link
=====================

There's nothing that _says_ the fellow pulling out the magical artifact of holy
power _needs_ to be a blond, green-clad Hylian undergoing puberty.

This kid might wish there _were_ though. Because that stupid sword _hurts_.

Shade is a Twili with an endlessly curious spirit. He's only _in_ this
situation because he wandered off, found a weird forest, and decided to have a
go at the free sword that he found. He is now regretting precisely _all_ of his
life decisions. Hero of legend he ain't.

Personality
-----------

Shade is a curious sort, the kind that will easily get distracted for a solid
month doing sidequests.

Combat
------

Mostly a magic user for two reasons. One, that's what he was trained to do, so
it comes more easily to him than swordplay. The _other_ is that his only weapon
at the moment is the Master Sword which does not get along with him. At all.

Legend

* Lore _fascinates_ him.
* Gen gives him a lot of weird looks.
* Shadow is scary.
* He is forever sad that he'll never get to ride around in Dusk's shadow. He
  seems nice.
