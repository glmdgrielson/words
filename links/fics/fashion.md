# A Tour of Fae's Wardrobe

The best day of Link's life was the day Mother told him he could finally wear
the designs he had been working so hard on. Link had always liked looking
pretty and he greatly enjoyed showing himself off. He took after Mother that
way. And yet Mother always told him he was too young to do so. He knew she
meant well, but it was frustrating that he couldn't look the way he wanted to,
just because some people would have a fit. (It would be a good while before he
properly understood the consequences for a small child showing off too much
skin. Link didn't like to think about it too much.) But when he _did_ get to
look the way he liked, he never turned back. His wardrobe was finely tailored,
handmade as often as Link thought he could get away with it, and every garment
was given just a touch of Mother's magic to make it just a little bit more
special. Link liked that last part; it meant Mother enjoyed his creation.

Link didn't travel much. He was usually too busy attending to Mother's shrine,
handling the upkeep in places she was too big to reach or escorting people to
and from where she lurked. Every so often though, he would be sent out to learn
more about the world around him. Link often used this as an opportunity to use
some of his pieces in their proper environments.

For example, today he was off to investigate a Zora city. He had brought with
him a two-piece swimsuit, flowing with the contours of his body. It was almost
a shame that he hadn't properly learned to swim yet, but he supposed that was
something he could learn to do here. After all, "like a fish takes to water" is
an expression that would be almost _too_ appropriate for this situation.
