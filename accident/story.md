There... was an accident. A long thread of fate, snipped too early. A child
destined for great things, taken too soon. A fire alarm that hadn't been
checked properly. A routine error in the fabric of the universe. Destiny had
been irrevocably altered, not out of malice or a desire to change what cannot
be changed, but out of carelessness.

The guides had seen too many infants. It had become a tradition to raise them
as their own and give them the chance at life that had been taken from them.
This child would be no exception. They would be raised as a guide and given
the training to improve the lot of the living. They were given the name Avery.
Avery had matured quickly for a soul that not gotten the time to come into
their own in the world of the living.
