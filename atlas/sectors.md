How do Sectors work?
====================
- Things a Sector would need in order to be able to store humans long-term:
    - food production
    - water filtration
    - waste disposal
    - power generation (probably ship-level)
    - air filtration
    - temperature control
    - emergency storage(?)
    - fabrication/manufacturing
    - fire suppression
    - inter-sector communication (I want this to be limited for narrative
      reasons, though)
        - personal communication limited to Sector governors
- Lifestyle requirements for long-term human storage:
    - sleeping area
    - hygiene
    - fitness centers
    - work zones (may relate to prior points)
