Trip Amongst the Stars (TBC)
============================

Raziol was shaken. His mentor figure had just told him his plans to leave. He
didn't know what to do. This couldn't happen to him. Not again. Not after
everything Huygens did for him. It was unthinkable. And yet it had just
happened.

He had run off in a fit of despair. Raziol struggled to figure out what he was
going to do when he ran into somebody standing by the fountain. Almost
literally, it was a miracle that Raz didn't get soaked. "I am terribly sorry,
sir."
