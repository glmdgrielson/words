Force Gems

The Links were having a break. A _shopping_ break. Which meant that most of
the Links had broken away.

This meant that Green found it _very_ difficult to resist Red's call for a cute
plushie. Usually that's when Gen would step in and say they have to spend the
money on more Red Potions or somesuch, and Green didn't have or _get_ to say
anything else on the matter. But now they were alone. And Red wanted a big soft
cuddly for fifty green things.

_Shouldn't be too much of a problem_, Green thought as he put down a single
Purple Force Gem down on the market stall. "One plushie please."

"That'll be fifty Rupees."

Green blinks and points to the purple pyramidal gem. "Is that not gonna do it?"

"Kid, I'm asking for _money_, not whatever that is."

"THAT IS MONEY!"

"Not here it isn't. I need fifty _Rupees_, kid."

"What in Din's name are you talking about?"

Blue attempted to say something, but Green cut him off saying "I swear to
Nayru, Blue, do _not_ start something. I am trying to _negotiate_ with this man
and I'm losing my patience. Now, do you have change for a Purple?"

Green tried again with ten blue gems. "I want the plush please."

"That's still not money, kid. You've just changed one rock for different rocks
and you expect me to believe that's change."

Green pleaded to Vio "Back me up here, please?"

Vio looked up from the economics book and simply shook his head. However, by
this point, Gen had heard the shouting match and stormed over.

"Green, I thought you were one of the _reasonable_ ones."

"This shopkeep won't accept my money!"

"This _kid_ is trying to get me accept his playthings as if they're real."

"THEY'RE CALLED FORCE GEMS AND THEY **ARE** MONEY."

Gen pulled Green aside and deadpanned "What in Hylia's name is a Force Gem?"

It was at that moment that Green finally lost it. "Red, I guess we're _not_
getting you your plushie."

And then Blue pointed out "Red's not _here_. He wandered off a bit ago."
