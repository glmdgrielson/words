NetNavi
=======

It all started when somebody sent me a weird app. They told me that they had
finally figured out how to make "sentient computers". Naturally, I thought that
was a load of crockery, but... I had an idea. Something I always kind of wanted
to have as a kid.

See, there was these old GBA games called _Mega Man Battle Network_ that I used
to play as a kid. One of those early looks at the internet full of all the
wonder Tim Berners-Lee had brought us before Facebook and Twitter crushed it.
And there were these avatars people had, Net Navigators or something like that.
The games always called them NetNavis. They were like Clippy, but with
personalities that didn't make you want to punch them in the face merely for
existing!
