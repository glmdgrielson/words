Harbourmaster
=============

## Opening

So, let's see--

> Shadow is dispatched by Ghost.

What was that for?

> Ghost holds up a sign saying "This one's mine" and hands the Shadow a script.

Aaaaah, Harbourmaster, okay, that explains it.

## Intro Card

> The Shadow is in front of a computer next to Tal.

Let me show you this wonderful website called Archive of Our Own...

## Pitch

Welcome to the Archives, wherein I ramble about my preferred medium, the
webcomic.  Today's experiment is Harbourmaster, from Wayward Martian Graphics.
It's about politics. This is your cue to head for the hills.

> There is a noticeable pause.

Okay, now that the shouting match is out of the way, yes, it's about politics
but in a ...good way. It's a setting where cooler heads prevail and the scope
is small enough that a lot of the ugliness is gone from the simple virtue that
_[singing] everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came._ ...I
should watch _Cheers_ one of these days.

Anyway, so the basic setup is that a great leader known as Partasah suddenly
carks it and in his place is Tal Monteblanc. Why this former aristocrat got
picked instead of, y'know, his own _kid_, is a riddle for the ages, but this is
the setup for Tal and the aforementioned kid, Gilou, to get to know each other.
And no, this isn't a romance, I'm pretty sure Tal himself would be the first to
complain if his story wound up being a romance. Dude's ace as heck.

## Recap

TBD

## Thoughts

So, a lot of the fantasy here is political in nature, both in the sense that it
deals very heavy with intergalactic politics in its themes, but also in that
the politics being _featured_ are a fantasy as well, in the same way that
Ankh-Morpork is a fantasy. It cuts out a lot of the ugliness that makes modern
day politics a chore to follow: the scope is small, the power structures are
tiny enough that corruption isn't much of a _thing_, and it all just comes off
as _reasonable_.

Which is why I can't stand Veras and anything to do with it, because it throws
all that niceness out the window.
