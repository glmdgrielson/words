Harbourmaster
=============

## Opening

So, let's see--

> Shadow is dispatched by Ghost.

What was that for?

> Ghost holds up a sign saying "This one's mine" and hands the Shadow a script.

Aaaaah, Harbourmaster, okay, that explains it.

## Intro Card

> The Shadow is in front of a computer next to Tal.

Let me show you this wonderful website called Archive of Our Own...

## Pitch

Welcome to the Archives, wherein I ramble about my preferred medium, the
webcomic.  Today's experiment is Harbourmaster, from Wayward Martian Graphics.
It's about politics. This is your cue to head for the hills.

> There is a noticeable pause.

Okay, now that the shouting match is out of the way, yes, it's about politics
but in a ...good way. It's a setting where cooler heads prevail and the scope
is small enough that a lot of the ugliness is gone from the simple virtue that
_[singing] everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came._ ...I
should watch _Cheers_ one of these days.
