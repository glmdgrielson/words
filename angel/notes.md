Angel
=====
* I'm imagining a Sentai-style story based around two teams: Angelrogue and
  Angelsleuth. ...yes, I was inspired by VS Sentai.
* Major theme of "what does it mean to do the right thing?" and what happens
  when two different definitions of "the right thing" get into nasty conflicts
  with one another.

Angelrogue
----------
* Colors are the traditional red, yellow, and blue.
* These are akin to master thieves in terms of theming. Not necessarily on the
  right side of the law, and not afraid of underhanded tricks.

Angelsleuth
-----------
* Colors are orange, green, and purple. Very deliberately the inverses of the
  other team.
* Pattern themselves after the classical Holmes-style detective. They pride
  themselves on being upstanding citizens, preferring not to subvert the law
  or use physical force if they can help it.
